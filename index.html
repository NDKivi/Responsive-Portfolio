                Lover of languages and logic, I studied math, computer science, philosophy, French, and Wolof at UW-Madison. Since then,
                I worked for the past 4 years as a Technical Services Engineer, focused on finding root causes to technical
                issues and creative solutions to business needs in healthcare. I am enrolled in the University of Minnesota
                Coding Bootcamp that started in June. I am looking for an entry-level position in software development after
                the program ends in late August.

                <br> My profile picture is from Tampere, Finland, which I visited last year. It is the only country I have visited
                in Europe and one of three countries I have been to outside the US. Can you guess the other two? Probably
                not: Senegal and The Gambia.
